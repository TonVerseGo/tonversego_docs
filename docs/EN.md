# TonVerse Go! (EN)

👏 TonVerse Go is a geolocation NFT game built on the TON blockchain. 📍Users explore real places, find NFT objects using the mobile app, and inside the Telegram Mini App all the management of the found NFTs happens. 

### 🎛️ Exactly what kind of management happens in the Mini App?

In our app inside Telegram, users will be able to sell their NFT finds on an internal marketplace for the crypto-token $VERSE, which we plan to launch together with the project. Also, inside the Telegram Mini App there will be educational material for those who are new to the crypto world.

### 👾 Why this idea will gain a lot of users?

1. People like to earn 💰
2. People like to earn without doing anything 🛌💰
3. People like to go out 🚶
4. People are interested in learning things that were unknown to them 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️🤷
5. There has never been a project like this on the TON blockchain before 🆕
6. Explosive idea 💥

### 📢 How will everything technically work?

1. User goes into the bot
2. Undergoes training (if required)
3. Connects his/her TON wallet via TON Connect
4. Gets a secret login to log in to the app
5. User enters the code in the app

🎉 And now the user already has access to the app. But what's next? 🧐

*After dropping the gifts.*

1. The user enters the app and sees that there are gifts nearby. By the indicator on top (hot/cold) he determines how far away he is from the gift
2. The user approaches the gift and a Claim button appears, which gives the user the opportunity to receive the gift
3. After sending the information to the server, the received gift is sent to the user's TON wallet.
4. *(Optionally) The user can place his/her gift on our marketplace.*
